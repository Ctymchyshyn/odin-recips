     <h3>This is the best beef stroganoff recipe I know. It's well worth the effort. I have been making this for over 20 years!</h3>
     <p> This is some of the best beef stroganoff ever! I used sirloin instead of chuck roast and let that marinate in red wine, garlic, and Worcestershire for two hours before cooking. I cooked that then plated it. I used a combination of green onions and vidalia, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire, white wine and minced garlic. After I added the meat back in I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of corn starch. I added that to thicken then added the sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. This was fabulous served over egg noodles - YUM!</p>
