        <h3>A simple, yummy recipe for basted eggs.</h3>
        <p>This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1/8 teasoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
         <h4>Steps</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute. Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
         </ol>
